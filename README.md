# Step 3: Reverse proxy with apache (static configuration)

## Webcasts

* [Labo HTTP (3a): reverse proxy apache httpd dans Docker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHFlWdcvZtk)
* [Labo HTTP (3b): reverse proxy apache httpd dans Docker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkPwHyQUiVs)

## Acceptance criteria

* You have a GitHub repo with everything needed to build the Docker image for the container.
* You do a demo, where you start from an "empty" Docker environment (no container running) and where you start 3 containers: static server, dynamic server and reverse proxy; in the demo, you prove that the routing is done correctly by the reverse proxy.
* You can explain and prove that the static and dynamic servers cannot be reached directly (reverse proxy is a single entry point in the infra).
* You are able to explain why the static configuration is fragile and needs to be improved.
* You have documented your configuration in your report.
